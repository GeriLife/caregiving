## Introduction and Purpose

**Project Name**: GeriLife Caregiving

**Welcome to GeriLife Caregiving**, an open-source initiative born from a blend of compassionate volunteering and innovative technology. Our journey began in the halls of an institutional elder care facility, where the simple act of choosing residents for daily activities unveiled a more profound need for inclusivity and coordination in caregiving.

**Purpose**: This project aims to transform how quality-of-life activities are managed and recorded in elder care facilities. Our experiences as volunteers revealed a critical gap: Although the caregivers meticulously tracked essential care such as hygiene, medication, and nutrition, they often needed more coordination in organizing life-enriching activities. Popular or socially active residents were frequently chosen for activities, unintentionally leaving others less engaged. This imbalance sparked family concerns about their loved ones' inactivity despite the facility's world-renowned care standards.

Recognizing this, we embarked on a mission to make the "invisible" visible. Our solution is a digital, shared activity notebook—a tool where caregivers can log and track the activities they facilitate. This system aims to empower each resident by highlighting their activity patterns and enabling them to participate in activities that align with their abilities and interests. The system achieves this by actively guiding and supporting each individual towards their preferred activities.

Through this platform, we're not just logging activities but fostering a more inclusive and well-rounded approach to caregiving. By providing caregivers with an easy-to-use tool to record and view activity data, we empower them to make informed decisions that enrich the lives of all residents. Everyone contributes to a more vibrant, engaging, and equitable environment for older people, from volunteers to professional caregivers.

In essence, GeriLife is more than just a software tool; it's a commitment to enhancing the quality of life for older adults, promoting equality in care, and building a community around the shared values of compassion and innovation in elder care. Join us in this endeavor to bring a new level of transparency, coordination, and inclusivity to elder care facilities worldwide.

## Inspiration and Background

**A Volunteer's Insight**: Our journey with GeriLife began not in front of screens or keyboards but within the bustling environment of an institutional elder care facility. It was here, amid the day-to-day activities, where a nurse sowed the seed of our project. As a volunteer, I engaged with residents, bringing them joy through simple activities like walks, music sessions, or group events. However, choosing which residents to invite often fell to the on-duty nurses, who, despite their best intentions, tended to select the more social or visible residents. This unintentional bias left a silent but significant portion of the community overlooked.

**Uncovering a Hidden Need**: The turning point came when internal reports and media coverage echoed concerns from residents' families about their loved ones' lack of activity. These families voiced that their relatives were often left sitting in their rooms, leading a primarily inactive lifestyle. This inactivity was particularly concerning given the facility's excellent reputation for providing top-notch care in hygiene, medication, and nutrition. It became apparent that while essential caregiving was well-tracked and coordinated, quality-of-life activities, often reliant on volunteers like myself, needed more organization and visibility.

**From Observation to Action**: In search of a solution, a nurse suggested I use a small paper notebook to record the activities I facilitated—names of the residents, the nature of the activity, dates, and other observations. This humble beginning, documenting activities in a notebook, gradually revealed a powerful narrative: the need for a coordinated approach to ensure every resident had equal opportunities for engagement and enrichment.

**The Birth of GeriLife**: Inspired by this realization, we digitized and expanded this concept. The goal was to create a tool that would not only track these activities but also highlight the participation patterns of all residents. A simple yet profound belief fueled this initiative: regardless of social visibility or popularity, everyone deserves an equal chance to partake in activities that brighten their days and enhance their overall well-being.

**Collaborative Efforts with a Co-Founder**: The project took a significant leap forward with the involvement of my co-founder, a manager at the elder care facility. Her extensive nursing, institutional care, management, and communication expertise was invaluable. She played a crucial role in shaping the features of GeriLife, tailoring them to meet the needs of various stakeholders, from family members to nurses, managers, and municipal administrators. Her insights were fundamental in securing an agreement for a pilot project with the City of Tampere, leading to substantial improvements based on user feedback. Her knowledge complemented my technology, web development, and data visualization background, making our combined skills pivotal in bringing GeriLife to life.

In summary, GeriLife is more than just a response to a logistical challenge; it is a heartfelt response to a human need. Recognizing and addressing subtle disparities in care is crucial to ensuring that every resident is valued and supported to thrive in their environment. This project is our commitment to enhancing the lives of older people, rooted in the real-world experiences and genuine concerns of those we serve.

## Solution: Shared Activity Notebook

**Transforming Elder Care with Technology**: At the heart of GeriLife lies our innovative solution—a Shared Activity Notebook, meticulously designed to address the overlooked aspects of elder care. This digital tool is our answer to a critical need: bringing visibility and coordination to quality-of-life activities for residents in elder care facilities.

**Digital Evolution of a Simple Idea**: The Shared Activity Notebook is a direct evolution of the paper notebook concept, leveraging technology to enhance its impact. Initially, the paper notebook served as a rudimentary yet effective way to record activities and participant details. Recognizing the potential of this approach, we developed a digital platform that not only retains the simplicity of the original idea but also introduces powerful features for comprehensive activity management.

**Key Features of the Shared Activity Notebook**:

1. **Effortless Data Entry**: Caregivers can easily log activities, participants, dates, and other pertinent details. The interface is designed for simplicity, allowing quick and hassle-free updates.
2. **Inclusive Activity Tracking**: The tool records every resident's participation, highlighting those who may be less visible or socially active, promoting inclusivity in activity selection.
3. **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Caregivers and administrators can access various views of the activity data. This includes individual resident activity history, overall activity trends in the facility, and distribution of activities by type (e.g., outdoor, games, socializing).
4. **Empowering Stakeholders**: Different stakeholders can access tailored information. Family members can view their loved one's activity history, nurses can oversee the facility's overall engagement, and managers can observe broader trends and make informed decisions.
5. **Actionable Insights**: By analyzing activity trends and participation patterns, caregivers can identify areas needing attention and plan future activities more effectively, ensuring equitable engagement for all residents.

**Impact of the Shared Activity Notebook**:

- **Enhanced Resident Engagement**: By providing a clear picture of each resident's activity participation, the tool helps caregivers ensure that no one is left out, fostering a more vibrant and inclusive community.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The aggregated data empowers caregivers and administrators to make informed decisions about resource allocation, activity planning, and overall care strategies.
- **Building a Connected Community**: This tool serves as a bridge between different caregivers (professional, family, volunteers), enabling coordinated efforts and a unified approach to resident engagement.

In conclusion, the Shared Activity Notebook is not just a technological solution; it's a commitment to enhancing the quality of life for elders in care facilities. We're creating a more equitable, engaged, and connected elder care community by making the invisible visible. Join us in revolutionizing elder care, one activity at a time.

## Impact and Insights

**Observing Progress in Elder Care**: As GeriLife journeyed through its nearly three-year pilot phase, we witnessed a remarkable upward trend in the recorded activities within the participating elder care facilities. The increased documented engagement is a heartening indicator of the project's potential impact on older people's and their caregivers' lives.

**Tentative Yet Hopeful Observations**:

- **Increased Activity Recording**: During the pilot, we observed a substantial rise in the number of activities recorded in our Shared Activity Notebook. While we are cautious about attributing this solely to the tool's effectiveness, the data paints a promising picture of enhanced engagement and awareness among caregivers.
- **Factors Influencing the Trend**: Several factors might contribute to this uptrend:
  - **Caregiver Familiarization**: As caregivers became more accustomed to using the tool, their efficiency and consistency in logging activities improved.
  - **Wider Roll-Out**: The pilot initially included a smaller set of homes, gradually expanding to more facilities. This broader implementation likely contributed to the increased volume of recorded activities.
  - **Staffing Changes and Insights**: Changes in staffing, potentially influenced by insights provided by our tool, might have played a role in improving activity engagement and recording.
